        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Luke. I am a computer science student.
            Since I was young I wanted to be a software developer.
            I grew up around video games and computers and always had a curiosity
            towards technology. I began modding the video games I played and before long I
            found myself having as much fun developing mods as I was playing the game.
            Nowadays I enjoy learning new things and working on small projects.
        </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
           One of the main things I like to do in my free time is play video games. I also enjoy listening to a wide variety of music.
           When I am not doing one of those things I enjoy working on programming projects. I like to know what makes the things I use
           everyday work and creating my own small prototypes.
        </p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
            <div class="projectscolumn">
                <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the website you are seeing now, which I made for a university assignment.
                    As you can see, when the cursor is moved a pixel effect follows it. This effect
                    is actually something called Conway's game of life. Each pixel represents a cell
                    and they die or spread depending on their surrondings. Moving your cursor places
                    cells below it. This was made in vanilla javascript with no framework.
                </p>
                <h3>B Tree Implementation in Rust</h3>
                <p>
                    When first learning Rust I chose to implement a B tree as a project
                    to learn the language. A B-tree is a type of data structure called a tree.
                    A tree is a data structure which represents a heirarchy of nodes, with only
                    one root node being at the very top. A B-Tree splits branches into ranges of
                    indexes, which makes it very fast for searching across lots of nodes and a
                    good choice for database systems.
                </p>
                <h3>Kernel Space Programs</h3>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    I have also created multiple small programs that run in kernel space. Each of these
                    have a UEFI program on them which allow them to be booted from a USB. These programs
                    each do different things, one can read data from the disk, the other writes to
                    a graphics framebuffer and can display images. These small projects were deceptively
                    complicated with no standard library to rely on, and taught me alot about assembly
                    and computers.
                </p>
                <h3>Map of Spotify</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project I created a kind of 'map' of spotify. I wrote a script that recursively builds a graph
                    of spotify artists. The script would start at an artist A. It would then look at the artists that users who like A
                    most often listen to. From there it would add A as a node then add these similar artists as nodes
                    and link them to A. It would then go to the first similar artist B and add their similar artists as nodes
                    and link them to B. It would then go to the second similar artist of A, C and do the same. Once it had linked all
                    of A's similar artists it would repeat the process with B, then C and so on. Recursively building a graph of artists
                    on spotify. I then visualized this data using a python graphing library.
